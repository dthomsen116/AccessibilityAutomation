## About

This capstone mission is rooted in my commitment to revolutionizing accessibility in organizational environments through the automation of desktop creation. My goal is to develop a comprehensive framework that enhances desktop accessibility within enterprise virtualization applications. By employing automation and empowering users to specify their accessibility preferences during desktop creation, I aim to contribute to a more inclusive digital workspace. Through collaborative efforts and leveraging cutting-edge technologies, this project seeks to establish a scalable and adaptable solution for advancing accessibility in diverse organizational settings.
