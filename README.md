# Automating Accessibility Capstone Project

</div>

<div align="center">

## Mission Statement:

My goal with this project is to create an application that can be utilized during the onboarding process to allow all employees to customize a custom desktop designed for their accessibility. I am working with many different skills and tools that I have utilized throughout my [course history](https://github.com/dthomsen116#courseload) as my college years come to an end. By employing automation and empowering users to specify their accessibility preferences during desktop creation, I aim to contribute to a more inclusive digital workspace for the future of workplaces.

## Proof Of Concept:

Due to time limitations, there were features that I have not had time to add yet but would be easy to implement given slightly more time.

Please read the [Proof Of Concept](https://github.com/dthomsen116/AccessibilityAutomation/wiki/Proof-Of-Concept-Warning) page for more information.
However:

I plan to continue work on this as a side project to tie up these loose ends after graduation and on my own time for personal gratification as I know that I am capable of these additions.
