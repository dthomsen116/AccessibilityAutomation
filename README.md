## Mission Statement:

In today's digitally connected world, ensuring accessibility is crucial, especially in workplace environments. This project aims to tackle this issue by developing an application that customizes desktop environments according to individual needs. By simplifying the onboarding process, this tool integrates accessibility seamlessly into workplace practices. Personalized configurations empower employees with tailored environments and promotes inclusivity by removing the stigma associated with requesting accommodations. Despite encountering challenges such as failed implementations and scope limitations, this proof of concept demonstrates technical feasibility and lays the groundwork for future development. In the end, the goal is to prioritize inclusivity in technology and contribute to a more accessible digital society.


## Use Case

This tool is designed to streamline the onboarding process for new employees by facilitating the customization of their desktop environments based on individual accessibility requirements. Upon candidate selection, individuals are prompted to complete a form detailing their specific accessibility needs. This solution addresses two critical aspects of workplace accessibility:

- Ensuring built-in accessibility for all employees, thereby enabling personalized desktop configurations tailored to individual needs.
- Fostering an environment where employees with desktop accessibility requirements feel integrated rather than singled out, fostering a culture where every voice contributes to a more accommodating workspace.

## Proof Of Concept:

Due to time limitations, there were features that I have not had time to add yet but would be easy to implement given slightly more time.

Please read the [Proof Of Concept](https://github.com/dthomsen116/AccessibilityAutomation/wiki/Proof-Of-Concept-Warning) page for more information.
However:

I plan to continue work on this as a side project to tie up these loose ends after graduation and on my own time for personal gratification as I know that I am capable of these additions.
